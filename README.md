#1 - Madlibs

In a traditional Madlib, you have a bunch of blanks in a paragraph. Somebody would fill out those blanks, then read the paragraph out loud with the words that they chose in those blanks.

This project is completed using the concept of string concatenation.
For our madlib, we define 1 adjective, 2 verbs, and 1 noun to complete our string.
