#1 - **Madlibs**

In a traditional Madlib, you have a bunch of blanks in a paragraph. Somebody would fill out those blanks, then read the paragraph out loud with the words that they chose in those blanks.

This project is completed using the concept of string concatenation.
For our madlib, we define 1 adjective, 2 verbs, and 1 noun to complete our string.

#2 - **Guess the number (Computer)**

Here, we create a guessing game you can play, but the computer has the secret number! Our goal is to attempt to guess that number.

The first step is having the computer generate a secret, random number. 

In this script, we're starting to implement looping methods, with `while`, `if`, and `elif`.  

Try to beat the computer in under 3 tries, while it guesses a number between 1 and 10!

#3 - **Guess the number (User)**

Alternatively of the last script, we're going to flip the script onto the computer, and have guess our number. Using functions and while loops, we've gotten the computer to guess our random, and we've also guessed the computers random number!
